# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

## Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |              20 classes        |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |             100   LOC/class         | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | |  2000 LOC
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                         200 person hours             |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 600â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |            2 weeks        |               
## Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
| Identify user requirements |  30 person hour |
| Identifiy performance requirements |  20 person hour |
| Requirement document |  30 person hour |
| Identify the best architecture and design |  40 person hour |
| Design Document |  30 person hour |
| Implementation |  100 person hour |
| Verification |  50 person hour |
| Project management |  10 person hour |
| Configuration management |  10 person hour |
| Documentation of the system use |  25 person hour |

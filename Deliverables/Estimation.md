# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

## Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |              20 classes        |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |             150   LOC/class         | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |   3000 LOC     |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |    300 person hours    |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 9000â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  2 weeks      |               
## Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name                     | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| -----------                               | ------------------------------- | 
| Identify user requirements                |  40 person hour |
| Identifiy performance requirements        |  40 person hour |
| Requirement document                      |  40 person hour |
| Identify the best architecture and design |  30 person hour |
| Design Document                           |  40 person hour |
| Implementation                            |  50 person hour |
| Verification                              |  40 person hour |
| Validation                                |  40 person hour |
| Project management                        |  16 person hour |
| Configuration management                  |  16 person hour |
| Documentation of the system use           |  40 person hour |
